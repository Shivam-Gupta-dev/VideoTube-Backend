📺 VideoTube Backend

This is a backend REST API project built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as part of my backend learning journey.
The project was mimicked from a tutorial, and the entire codebase was written independently to understand real-world backend concepts such as authentication, API design, and media handling.

🛠 Tech Stack

Node.js

Express.js

MongoDB

JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Cloudinary

dotenv

✨ Key Concepts Implemented

REST API development using Express

JWT-based user authentication

MongoDB integration using Mongoose

Media upload and storage using Cloudinary

Backend project structuring using controllers, routes, and models
